# BitDifferenceSum
Prints the sum of the bit difference

Run App.java inside com.uber.poc

This will take in a String input in form of a comma-seperated String and then prints the sum of bit differences in the below mentioned fashion:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2}
Output: 4
All pairs in array are (1, 1), (1, 2)
                       (2, 1), (2, 2)
Sum of bit differences = 0 + 2 +
                         2 + 0
                      = 4

Input:  arr[] = {1, 3, 5}
Output: 8
All pairs in array are (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5)
                       (3, 1), (3, 3) (3, 5),
                       (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Sum of bit differences =  0 + 1 + 1 +
                          1 + 0 + 2 +
                          1 + 2 + 0 
                       = 8
